# socketreactstarter

A starter for socket.io and react

Just learning how to upload to git. Hopefully this becomes helpful, this react-socket starter. I'll be making changes, etc, as I learn more and fumble my way through.

Long story short - I didn't have a .gitignore in the main folder, so I added my .env file.. (only had a port in it, I knew that, when learning, keep it low risk), node modules, then, having react in a frontend folder, its added that as a submodule. Still working on deleting that.

Got it! Had to delete the .git from the frontend folder

Thanks!
